## Past Configurations and Insperations

First off most of this porject will be documented in this README markdown along with the history of the project, and much of the troubleshooting done to get the server to where it is now.

To begin with this project started for me in 2017 when I first heard about FreeNAS through learning how to build computers on youtube. Like most who are uneducated about the server space I thought it was an extremely complicated mechanisnm that would be extremely difficult to understand. Now I know that a server is really just a regular computer with different hardware requirements running a differnt Operating System. So begain my first FreeMAS server on an old laptop with a single 160 GB Hard Drive and a bootable USB.This system worked for what it was but was limited by the single 100 mbps ethernet port on the old laptop and was only used for archivel data. 

It would eventually be upgraded to a 1TB Hard Drive and a 250 GB Boot SSD that would allow for more fetures to be used in newly released TrueNAS Core such as a plex media server. However without any hardware redundancy and a cheap drive this NAS' storage drive would eventually become corrupted and all the data on it lost.
